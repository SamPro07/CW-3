# Course Work 3 - Multithreading

This is the repo for your third piece of coursework. There is a file included that is composed of a set of Steam games descriptions. Process this to make a single column in a separate file as is outlined in the coursework description.

## CMake

There is a simple CMakeLists.txt file included that you can base your code on. Any changes that you make should be reflected in here. The code you submit should be just the files that you have created / changed and the .csv file itself.

If you need any help, please get in touch.
